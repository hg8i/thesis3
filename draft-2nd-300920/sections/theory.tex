\chapter{Mathematical Background}

The Universe consists of particles, the space they inhabit, and the interactions between them.
Experimental observations are the foundations of the our knowledge of these building blocks.
The most complete mathematical description of these building blocks based, on experimental knowledge, is the Standard Model of particle physics.

The Standard Model, as a theory, is built on a foundation of abstract algebra.
In particular, the Standard Model is defined in terms of groups, elements, and their representations.
A description of these concepts and their homomorphisms to Nature may be found in Appendix \ref{sec:groups}.
This chapter is divided into two sections.
First, Section \ref{sec:thyIntro} summarizes the experimental phenomena that the Standard Model must describe.
Second, Section \ref{sec:sm} defines the Standard Model and its relationship to experimental observations.
