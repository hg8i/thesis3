\chapter{Non-resonant Search for Contact Interactions}\label{sec:ci}

The dilepton invariant-mass spectra is a clear window into the dynamics of high energy collisions.
Studying dilepton mass has proved useful throughout the history of the of experimental particle physics.
In 1974, a group working at Brookhaven National Laboratory and another group working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center used the dielectron mass spectrum to discover the \jpsi resonance at \mee=3.1~GeV \cite{jpsiBnl}\cite{jpsiSlac}.
In 1977, a group working at Fermilab used the dimuon mass spectrum to discover the $\Upsilon$ resonance at \muu=9.5~GeV \cite{upsilon}.
In 1983, the UA1 group working at the SPS collider at CERN used both dielectron and dimuon events to detect the decay of the \Z boson at a mass of $\mll\approx95$~GeV\cite{z0ua1}.
Later in the same year, the UA2 group used dielectron events to produce a result of \mee=91.9~GeV.
The utility of the dilepton final state is owed to the fact that the final state consisting of two leptons is fully reconstructible.

% General non-resonant
The study presented in this chapter searches the dielectron and dimuon invariant mass spectra for new, broad excesses, appearing in the high mass tail.
In contrast to the discoveries of narrow resonant shapes mentioned in the previous paragraph, a broad excess of events is termed \emph{non-resonant}
Since many models of new physics outside the Standard Model predict such excesses, this search is designed to be agnostic as to the underlying source of the feature.

% Contact interactions
A particularly interesting cause of a non-resonant shape is a \emph{contact interaction} (CI) between quarks and leptons at an energy scale exceeding that of the collision energy.
Although direct resonant production is inaccessible, a contact interaction leads to off-shell production as well as interference with the SM.
A \qqll CI is interesting because it is a necessary outcome of quarks and leptons sharing a common substructure \cite{eichten}.

\caption{A schematic illustration of a possible set of mass ranges in this analysis. The monotonically falling total background shape is shown by the solid black line, while an example of a CI signal plus the total background shape is shown by the dotted red line. This CI signal shape corresponds to the last two terms in Eq. (2) for a destructive interference case. The two axes in the figure are shown in logarithmic scale. The data is fit in a low-mass control region (shaded blue area) where a potential bias from the presence of a signal is negligible. The resulting background shape is extrapolated from the control region into the high-mass signal region (shaded red area). The gap illustrated between the CR and the SR is found to be the preferred case for the destructive interference cases only.}

% Challenges
Searching for contact interactions is experimentally and phenomenologically challenging.
To do so probes the highest energy regimes and smallest length scales ever accessed.
The first challenge is the broad non-resonant shape of the benchmark signal, as shown in the red line of Figure \ref{fig:ciStrat}.
This shape is qualitatively similar to the shape of the background, so care needs to be taken to avoid fitting the background to a possible signal, thereby loosing sensitivity to new physics.
The second challenge is the high-mass regime of interest in the analysis. The region of interest for CI signals is in the tail of the invariant-mass spectra.
Careful attention must be paid to systematic uncertainties and \pt/\et resolution in this region.
The third challenge is in modeling statistical knowledge of the background in signal regions with very low occupancy.
In fact, the statistical and experimental uncertainties on the background expectation are of similar concern as the magnitude of the background itself.

% new analysis strategy: data-driven
To address these challenges, this analysis introduces a number of changes that depart from previous studies.
The result presented here is the first non-resonant dilepton search at the LHC to use a functional form fit to data to estimate the background, rather than a background estimate derived from simulated events.
This choice removes the dependence of the background on the theoretical assumptions made during simulation.
This is important because these assumptions are both significant, and poorly constrained in the high-mass regime.

% Solution: avoid fitting signal shape
The CI signals considered are a deviations from the expected gradient of the high-mass tail of the dilepton mass spectrum, and could easily be fit by a sufficiently flexible background function.
Therefore, the background at high masses is estimated from a low-mass control region (CR) where the contribution of the signals of interest are negligible.
A functional form is fit to the data in the CR, and extrapolated to higher masses.
The search is then performed in a high-mass signal region (SR).
The configuration of these mass ranges is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ciStrat}.
The extrapolation from CR to SR avoids fitting the data in the region where CI signals are expected.
This in turn removes the risk of the background fit adapting to a signal, if present in the data.
This CR/SR approach is essential in the case of (typically small) non-resonant signals, as when the entire mass range is fit, similar to Ref.~\cite{Aad:2019fac}, a non-resonant signal can be absorbed into the background model.

% Solution: avoid resolution, etc
The relative momentum resolution for high-\pt muons grows with \pt.
The absolute \et resolution for electrons also grows with \et.
A single-bin SR is used to remove the impact of resolution on the result.
All events falling within the SR are counted identically, which mitigates the importance of \et/\pt resolution.
This approach has the additional benefit of removing shape information in the signal region, which makes the results readily reinterpretable for signal models predicting different non-resonant shapes.

% new analysis strategy: Bayesian
Further, this analysis has been moved from a Bayesian statistical framework to a frequentist statistical framework, which removes the dependence on signal priors.
In the case where the interference between signal and SM processes is not negligible, e.g. for CI, the choice of one prior over another is less unmotivated~\cite{Aad:2012hf,EXOT-2016-05}.
A comparison showed little difference in sensitivity between the two approaches.

Finally, the transition to a background estimation from the data exchanges the systematic uncertainties in the predictions from simulation for statistical uncertainties in data.
The dominant uncertainty in the expected background in the new analysis is due to statistical fluctuations in the CR.
Next in importance is the uncertainty in the degree to which the extrapolation from the CR can produce a background estimate different from the underlying distribution, leading to a signal-like deflection in the SR. This uncertainty is quantified using the simulated background and its uncertainties.
The uncertainty third in importance is due to a possible signal contamination in the CR.

Two signal regions are considered for each lepton flavor, leading to four signal regions in total.
The first result of the analysis is limits on the \xsbr in each SR, which can readily be reinterpreted in terms of various new physics models.
This is a new development for non-resonant searches at the LHC.
The second result uses these four signal regions to set limits several contact interactions models.
