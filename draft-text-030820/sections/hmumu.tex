The joint observation of the Higgs boson by ATLAS \cite{atlashiggs} and CMS \cite{cmshiggs} in 2012 set the groundwork for the following study of this particle and its interactions.
One of the reasons that the Higgs boson is interesting is that the Englert-Brout-Higgs (BEH) mechanism generates mass terms for fermions through Yukawa couplings.
The most direct way to study these couplings is through the fermionic decay of the Higgs, described previously in Section \ref{sec:phenoHiggs}.
As the fermion branching ratios given Equation \ref{eqn:higgsDecayFermions} indicate, the Yukawa coupling is proportional to the fermion's mass squared.
Since the $H\to t\tbar$ decay is kinematically forbidden, the largest allowed branching fraction is to bottom quark pairs due to their large mass $m_b=4.2$~GeV. 
Despite this, the $Ht\tbar$ coupling can be measured through the ttH process described in Table \ref{tab:higgsProdDiagrams}.
The $Hb\bbar$ coupling was observed at the ATLAS experiment using the VH production channels. \cite{atlasHbb}
The next most massive fermion after the bottom quark is the tau lepton, with $m_\tau=1.8$~GeV, which has been studied by ATLAS \cite{atlasTauTau} and CMS \cite{cmsTauTau}.
% I don't want the thesis to be immediately out of date
Although the charm quark with comes next at $m_c=1.3$~GeV, the messy final state proves difficult to identify and study.
Searches for $H\to c\cbar$ remain insensitive even to $Hc\cbar$ couplings $\sim100$ times the standard model expectation.
This leaves the muon and the $H\mm$ coupling, where the muon's mass of $\m_\mu=0.1$~GeV results in a challengingly small branching fraction.
However, unlike the case with the charm quarks, the final state of two muons is easily identified.
The result is that the $H\mm$ is the third and most challenging Higgs Yukawa coupling that is feasible to study at ATLAS.

The $H\mm$ coupling is also unique, as both the $Hb\bbar$ and $H\tautau$ couplings are to third-generation fermions.
This means that the \hmm measurement adds a valuable point to the global picture of Higgs couplings, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:higgsMassCoupling}.
Measuring this coupling provides a test of the standard model, and also insights into the origin of the muon's mass.

Detecting the decays of Higgs to two muons is particularly challenging on two counts.
First, the Higgs branching fraction to muons is tiny ($2.18\times10^{-4}$).
Second, there is a sizeable irreducible dimuon background from Drell-Yan and Diboson processes.
Together these evoke the idiomatic needle-in-a-haystack to describe the search for \hmm.
It is only with the enormous number of events collected by ATLAS during the Run 2 data-taking campaign that it became feasible to perform this search.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% VH #################3

Of particular interest in this thesis are Higgs bosons produced through the VH production mechanisms.
These events offer both a chance to look at a new, unobserved phase space, as well as a contribution to the overall \hmm sensitivity.
The events where the vector boson decays leptonically are particularly useful.
The additional leptons in these events help differentiate VH from the Drell-Yan background and provide kinematic information for further discrimination.

\label{tab:vh-predict}
\end{table}

Studying VH/\hmm comes with additional challenges.
First is the tiny VH cross-section leading to relatively few signal events.
Second is how to use the new information from the W/Z leptonic decay products to separate the background from diboson production processes (ZZ and WZ).
% Techniques to address challenge
Careful choices are made in the selection criteria targeted at VH production in order to capture as many VH/\hmm events as possible.
A multivariate analysis (MVA) discriminant is used to take advantage of the W/Z decays' kinematic information.
Again careful steps must be taken to understand and limit the level of bias in the results that these techniques introduce and avoid invalidating the final measurements.

The VH production mechanisms, WH and ZH, shown in figure \ref{fig:vh-prod}, are the third and fourth leading Higgs boson production mechanisms at the LHC. The $\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV cross-section of WH is 1.36 pb, and the cross-section of ZH is 0.88 pb. The cross-section, combined with the branching ratio of $H\to\mu\mu$ of $2.18\times10^{-4}$, result in the number of expected events per 139 fb$^{-1}$ shown in the first column of table \ref{tab:vh-predict}. In addition to the quark originating ZH shown in figure \ref{fig:vh-prod}, gluon originating ZH (via quark loop and contributing $\approx10\%$) is also considered.

Three categories are used for the search.
One is based on a 4-lepton selection designed to capture ZH events, and two are based on a 3-lepton selection optimized for WH events.
These consider leptonic ZH events with $\mu\mu\mu\mu$ or $ee\mu\mu$ final states, and leptonic WH events with $\mu\nu\mu\mu$ or $e\nu\mu\mu$.
In the case of leptonic decays of the \W, only the charged lepton is reconstructed, while some inference about the neutrino may be obtained from the missing transverse energy.
The delimitation within a selection is based on the MVA discriminant, resulting in categories with high signal purity and low signal purity.
The search is performed in the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum across these three categories.
Additional results are interpreted for the inclusive four and three lepton selections.
A combination is performed using twenty categories that target other Higgs production mechanisms.
